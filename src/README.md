## Typechecking Rules

We use TypeScript to ensure type safety and catch errors early in the development process. Here are some of the key typechecking rules we follow:

- **No implicit any**: All variables and function return types must have explicit types.
- **No unused variables**: Unused variables are not allowed.
- **Explicit function return types**: All functions must have explicit return types.
- **Consistent type definitions**: We use interfaces for type definitions.
- **No non-null assertions**: Non-null assertions are not allowed.
- **No var requires**: The `require` statement is not allowed; use `import` instead.

These rules help maintain a clean and consistent codebase, making it easier to maintain and scale the application.
